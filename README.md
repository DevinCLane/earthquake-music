One day of earthquakes in one minute.

Reads from U.S. Geological Survey latest earthquakes in the U.S. from the last day of all magnitudes (including most worldwide events magnitude 4.5 and greater). The app then compresses the earthquakes to a one minute timeline and plays a note for each one and shows the location.
